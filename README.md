Trying Basic Deep Learning Projects :p

1. Face Mask Detection
2. Driver Drowsiness Detection
3. Video Summarization

1. FACE MASK DETECTION - 
This project is focussed on detecting whether an individual is wearing a mask or not.
The input will be a live video stream or an image.

2 DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION -
This project is focussed on alerting a driver while he feels drowsy by playing an alarm.
