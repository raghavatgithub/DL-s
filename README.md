Trying Basic Deep Learning Projects :p

1. Face Mask Detection
2. Driver Drowsiness Detection
3. Video Summarization

A. FACE MASK DETECTION - 
This project is focussed on detecting whether an individual is wearing a mask or not.
The input will be a live video stream or an image.

B. DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION -
This project is focussed on alerting a driver while he is detected appearing drowsy by playing an alarm.
The input will be a live video stream.
